      <td><strong>Default</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Examples</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>

<tr>
<td>
        
`lsp-translations.translationFiles`

</td>
<td>
        
```json
[
"./translations.json",
"./translations/*.json"
]
```

</td>
<td>Glob patterns for the translation files which contain all the translations of your project.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
    
  
<tr>
<td>
        
`lsp-translations.fileName.details`

</td>
<td>ðŸš«</td>
<td>An optional regex pattern for the file name which can provide extra details to the extension. Can be useful when your translation file name contains language like 'en'.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
    
    
<tr>
<td>
        
`lsp-translations.key.details`

</td>
<td>ðŸš«</td>
<td>An optional regex pattern for the key of a translation which can provide extra details to the extension. Can be useful when your translation keys contains a language like 'en'.</td>
<td>

```json
"^.+?\\.(?<language>.+?)\\."
```

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

`lsp-translations.key.filter`

</td>
<td>ðŸš«</td>
<td>An optional regex pattern to filter out unneeded parts of a translation key. For example: if you have a translation key like `123.abc.key` and you only provide `key` to your translation function, you can use this setting to filter out the unneeded parts. The first regex group would be the correct key name.</td>
<td></td>
